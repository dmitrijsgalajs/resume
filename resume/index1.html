        <p>
            I am a first year student studying computing course with a subpath of sftware engineering at 
            the university of northampton. I'm writing this paragraph in an attempt of creating a news 
            website for a web developement module assessment.
            I also work for John Lewis and partners on a part-time contracual hours basis, working three eight 
            hour shifts a week. Must admit that this is probably one of the most boring jobs I had in my entire life.
