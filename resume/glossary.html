                    <h2>Call Stack</h2>
                    <p>A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions — what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.</p>
                    
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>When a script calls a function, the interpreter adds it to the call stack and then starts carrying out the function.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Any functions that are called by that function are added to the call stack further up, and run where their calls are reached.</p></li>
                            <li><p>When the current function is finished, the interpreter takes it off the stack and resumes execution where it left off in the last code listing.</p></li>
                            <li><p>If the stack takes up more space than it had assigned to it, it results in a "stack overflow" error.</p></li>
                        </ul>
                    <h2>Figure</h2>
                    <p>The HTML &lt;figure&gt; element represents self-contained content, frequently with a caption (&lt;figcaption&gt;), and is typically referenced as a single unit.</p>
                    <h2>Figcaption</h2>
                    <p>The HTML &lt;figcaption&gt; element represents a caption or legend for the rest of the contents its parent &lt;figure&gt; element, if any.</p>
                    <h2>Flexbox</h2>
                    <p>Flexbox is the commonly-used name for the CSS Flexible Box Layout Module, a layout model for displaying items in a single dimension — as a row or as a column.

                        In the specification, flexbox is described as a layout model for user interface design. The key feature of flexbox is the fact that items in a flex layout can grow and shrink. Space can be assigned to the items themselves, or distributed between or around the items.
                        
                        Flexbox also enables alignment of items on the main or cross axis, thus providing a high level of control over the size and alignment of a group of items.</p>

                    <h2>CSS Grid Layout</h2> 
                    <p>
                        CSS Grid Layout excels at dividing a page into major regions or defining the relationship in terms of size, position, and layer, between parts of a control built from HTML primitives.

                        Like tables, grid layout enables an author to align elements into columns and rows. However, many more layouts are either possible or easier with CSS grid than they were with tables. For example, a grid container's child elements could position themselves so they actually overlap and layer, similar to CSS positioned elements.</p>
                        <h3>CSS Grid Properies</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>grid-template-columns</li>
                            <li>grid-template-rows</li>
                            <li>grid-template-areas</li>
                            <li>grid-template</li>
                            <li>grid-auto-columns</li>
                        </ul>
                    
                    <h2>CSS Flow Layout</h2>
                        <p>Normal Flow, or Flow Layout, is the way that Block and Inline elements are displayed on a page before any changes are made to their layout. The flow is essentially a set of things that are all working together and know about each other in your layout. Once something is taken out of flow it works independently.</p>
                        <h2> Block (CSS)</h2>
                        <p>A block on a webpage is an HTML element that appears on a new line, i.e. underneath the preceding element in a horizontal writing mode, and above the following element (commonly known as a block-level element). For example, &lt;p&gt; is by default a block-level element, whereas &lt;a&gt; is an inline element — you can put several links next to one another in your HTML source and they will sit on the same line as one another in the rendered output. Using the display property you can change whether an element displays inline or as a block (among many other options); blocks are also subject to the effects of positioning schemes and use of the position property.</p>
