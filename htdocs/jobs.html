                    <h1>ROLE OF A FRONT-END DEVELOPER</h1>
                    <p>A front-end web developer is responsible for implementing visual and interactive elements that users engage with through their web browser when using a web application. They are usually supported by back-end web developers, who are responsible for server-side application logic and integration of the work front-end developers do.</p>   
                    <p>AYour website is a sum of layers—structure, data, design, content, and functionality. Creating that user-facing functionality is the job of a front-end developer. Using a combination of markup languages, design, and client-side scripts and frameworks, the front-end developer creates the environment for everything that users see and touch: content, layout, and interaction.

                            When hiring a front-end developer, it’s helpful to have a broad view of how the front end of a site functions, what a front-end developer does, their responsibilities, and what their skills can contribute to your project.
                    </p>
                    <h2>WHERE CREATIVITY & INNOVATION COLLIDE</h2>
                    <p>The front-end developer creates interaction and user experience with scripts embedded in a site’s HTML. Everything a visitor to your site sees, clicks, or uses to input or retrieve information is the work of the front-end developer who creates client-side software that brings the site’s design to life. Scripts are downloaded by the browser, processed, and then run apart from the server.

                        This takes equal parts technology and vision. Front-end developers are the bridge between the designer and the back-end programmer, which means they have to be both creative and tech-savvy. Wondering how a designer’s final design becomes a living, breathing site? That’s front-end code in action—code that breaks the design down into components, then delivers information and functionality made possible by the back-end developer.
                            
                        Overall, they’re creating a web-based application that comes as close to a desktop experience as possible. Their focus is on user experience, and the technology they implement will hinge on how well it accomplishes that speed, efficiency, and smooth functionality.
                    </p>
                    <h2>FRONT-END LANGUAGES</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>JavaScript: With its frameworks and libraries, it’s the core of front-end development, and beyond. It was the first client-side language and is still the most ubiquitous client-side script on the web.</p></li>
                            <li><p>HTML5: HTML dictates a site’s organization and content, all interaction aside, so it’s something every front-end developer needs to know. HTML elements can annotate footers, headers, how text displays, how media and images appear, and more.</p></li>
                            <li><p>The latest standard for cascading style sheets (CSS), CSS3 is broken into modules and comprises the code for every graphic element—from backgrounds to font—that make up the look and feel of a website.</p>

                    <h2>FRONT-END FRAMEWORKS</h2>

                    <h1>ROLE OF OF THE BACK-END DEVELOPER</h1> 
                    <p>Your website or dynamic web application is a sum of layers—structure, design and content, and functionality. The technology and programming that “power” a site—what your end user doesn’t see but what makes the site run—is called the back end. Consisting of the server, the database, and the server-side applications, it’s the behind-the-scenes functionality—the brain of a site. This is the ecosystem of the database manager and the back-end developer.

                                The back end is a combination of a database and a software written in a server-side language, which are run on web servers, cloud-based servers, or a hybrid combination of both. A network’s server set-up can vary, with the server-side workload divided up between various machines (e.g., a server dedicated to housing the database).

                    <p>
                            Back-end developers use an array of programming languages and frameworks when building server-side software. They may choose a framework to suit their working style or a site’s specific requirements. They may also work with a language within a software stack. Popular back-end technology includes

                    <p>Depending on which “stack” you choose when building the back end, your back-end developer will need cross-component expertise.</p>
                    <p>What is a software stack? “Stacks” are just bundles of software for different aspects of your site’s back end, combined for their compatibility and functionality to streamline development and deployment. The components include an operating system, a web server, a database, and server-side scripting language. You’re not limited to the components in a stack—they’re interchangeable based on your needs and customizable. Learn more about how to choose the stack that’s right for your project.</p>
                    <h2>TWO COMMON STACKS:</h2>
                    <h3>LAMP: Linux/Apache/MySQL/PHP</h3>
                    <p>LAMP consists of free, open-source software components that work well for dynamic websites and applications. It’s the most traditional stack model, with a few variations for different operating systems, servers, and database options. In the LAMP stack, PHP is interchangeable with the languages Python and Perl.</p>
                    <p>LAMP benefits: flexible, customizable, easy to develop, easy to deploy, secure, and comes with a huge support community since it’s open source.</p>
                    <h3>MEAN: MongoDB/Express.js/AngularJS/Node.js</h3>
                    <p>MEAN is an all-JavaScript-powered replacement for the traditional LAMP stack. It’s excellent for businesses looking to be agile and scalable, offering flexibility with the MongoDB document-based database and lots of features for building single- and multipage web applications. By using JavaScript across the front and back ends, developers working on the client side can easily understand the server-side code, which leads to greater productivity for your team.</p>
                    <p>MEAN benefits: single language used, supports the MVC pattern, uses JSON for data transfer, offers access to Node.js’s JavaScript module library and the Express.js framework, is open source.</p>
